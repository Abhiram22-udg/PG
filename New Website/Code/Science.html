            <h2>The gist of this page</h2>
        <p>This year, instead of doing the standard presentation of 
            all the topics learnt, we decided to take it up a notch
            by focusing on two specific topics from term-2 syllabus
            and explaining them and their real life applications in
            depth.</p>

            <h2>Universal Law of Gravitation</h2>
            <p>Law of Universal Gravitation states that every particle attracts <br>every 
                other particle in the universe with force directly proportional<br> to the 
                product of the masses and inversely proportional to the <br> square of the 
                distance between them.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Relativity</h2>
            <p>The theory of relativity refers to two theories developed by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other, and describes how space and time are relative to the observer. General relativity extends this to include the effects of gravity and describes it as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. </p>

                <h3>Special Relativity</h3>
                <p>Special relativity is a theory of physics developed by Albert Einstein that describes the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. It asserts that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion, and that the speed of light is constant for all observers.</p>

                <h3>General Relativity</h3>
                <p>General relativity describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. According to general relativity, massive objects cause a distortion in spacetime, and objects moving in this distorted spacetime follow curved paths, which we perceive as the force of gravity.</p>

                    <p>In the theory of relativity, gravity is not a force between masses like in Newton's law of gravitation, but instead a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of massive objects. The curvature of spacetime determines the trajectory of objects moving nearby, and this apparent acceleration is interpreted as the effect of gravity

                    <p>Gravity and Theory of Relativity are also related in Time Dilation. According to the theory, the stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes. This means that time passes more slowly in a stronger gravitational field than it does in a weaker one. This effect, known as time dilation, has been confirmed by experiments with atomic clocks

        <h2 style="position: relative; margin-left: 50px;">UltraSound</h2>
        <p style="position: relative; margin-left: 50px;">ultrasound refers to sound waves that have a frequency higher than the upper limit of human hearing<br> 
            (typically considered to be 20,000 Hz). Ultrasound waves are produced when a rapidly changing <br> 
            electrical signal is applied to a piezoelectric material, such as a quartz crystal. This <br> 
            results in a mechanical vibration that produces a pressure wave in the surrounding medium, <br> 
            such as a liquid or a solid.</p>

        <p style="position: relative; margin-left: 50px;">Piezoelectricity is the electrical charge that is generated when certain materials, such as crystals,<br> are subjected to mechanical stress. The term "piezo" comes from the Greek word<br> for "pressure", and refers to the production of electricity from mechanical pressure. <br>Piezoelectric materials have the unique property of exhibiting a reverse effect as well, where <br>an applied electrical field can cause the material to deform, resulting in mechanical movement.</p>
