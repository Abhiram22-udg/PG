MATHS:

Maths, Regarded as the King of Subjects. This year there was a lot 
of things learnt in Maths but particularly there was this one concept called
Circles which was actually hard to grasp but pretty easy when understood.
This year in circle we explored a lot of properties of circles which I will
present now.

Circles:

Theorem 10.1 : Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the center.

Theorem: 10.2 : If the angles subtended by the chords of a circle at the centre equal, then the chords are equal(Converse)

Theorem 10.3 : The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord

Theorem 10.4 : The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord(Converse)

Theorem 10.5 : There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear points

Theorem 10.6 : Equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre.

Theorem 10.7 : Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal in length (Converse)

Theorem 10.8 : The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle

Theorem 10.9 : Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal

Theorem 10.10 : If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles ut other points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment, four points lie on a circle (i.e. they are concyclic).

Theorem 10.11 : The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180ยบ

Theorem 10.12 : If the sum of a pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is 180 , the quadrilateral is cyclic

These are the theorems and properties learnt this year in circle and there is 
one place where these are all used. That is Architecture. They are also in
designing of all the important mechanisms of cars like wheels,etc.

That concludes the maths page of project graduation.
