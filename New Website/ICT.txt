ICT:
ICT/Information Communication Technology has been my one of my 
favourite subjects this entire year(Probably because of my liking towards
computers) and I have paid a lot of attention during the class and I have
done a lot of things using the things I know and what I was taught.

Python:

I learnt the basics of Python and I have done a few programs as assignments
as well. The tool that was used to make all of this was Jupyter Notebook.
A few of the projects that I built myself are these.

Artificial Intelligence:

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a computer's or a robot controlled 
by a computer's capability to carry out tasks that are generally carried out 
by humans since they call for human intelligence and judgement. 
One of the most notable examples of AI in daily life is seen 
in Apple's Siri, Google Now, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana.

Natural Intelligence:

The capacity to recognise, categorise, and manipulate parts of the 
surrounding environment, objects, animals, or plants is known 
as natural intelligence. Natural intelligence combines 
several cognitive processes in order to adapt to new environments. 
The human brain is analogue, whereas machines are digital.

Activities:

We were also asked to do an activity which required us to use our
brains and make a small floorplan of the future house which we 
desire and add all the technological advancements which would
further make the house better and our lives easier.
