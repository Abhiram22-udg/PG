Social :

History:

This year, we went on something that every student waits for every year.
We went on a field trip and this time not only did we enjoy a lot
but we also did a lot of research, gained a lot of knowledge and 
had a jolly time with out friends. This field trip was to the Qutub shahi Tombs
and I know that It might sound boring but trust me, this was worth it.


We went and saw a lot of tombs over with friends and understood who they 
were and their history. A few of the tombs had the bodies of great sultans
who made the prior changes to the city of hyderabad and formed it in to 
what we see right now. One of the kings was Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah, the
fifth sultan of Qutb Shahi dynasty and he was the found who named Hyderbad,Hyderabad. 

The main Qutb Shahi Dynasty was the main ruling and it was the one 
that made the changes in hyderabad which made it so rich in culture. A few people
got to know then that the Golkonda fort was made thanks to them. We also
got to know the exact dates of what all events happened. Pretty much a timeline.

Oil,Environment and Energy :

Crude oil and it's uses: 
A mixture of hydrocarbons known as crude oil is one that is found in naturally 
occurring subsurface reservoirs in the liquid phase and continues to be liquid
at atmospheric pressure. Chemical Industry uses crude oil to make products such
plastics, polyurethane, etc. It is also a source of energy.

Map of oil reserves:

There are a lot of oil usages in developed countries like USA, etc. 
But oil should be conserved. Utilizing fewer fossil fuels lessens the
effects of climate change, lowers the price of oil dependence, improves
energy sustainability, and helps you save money.

Energy Consumption in the world:

This picture will actually show how much energy we are spending
according to timelines.

[Picture of that]

Now let's talk in small scale. Let's take the example of school and home.

In my school - amount of energy is being spent. 
In my home - amount is spent per month.

This is a proposal to shift to EV.

The Geopolitics related to oil and Energy :

The Russia-Ukraine war has shook the entire Geopolitics of the whole world.
This war has caused Russia to be sanctioned by the whole world but as said in
an article; You don't shut down the world's second largest commodity producer
and don't expect results. Russia being sanctioned has stopped a lot of export of 
energy sources and increased price of a lot of commodities like Aluminium, cobalt
natural gas etc. This has triggered the China-Taiwan Conflict as well as the Israel-
Palestine Conflict.

One environmental agreement:

The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which was adopted in 
1987 and aims to protect the Earth's ozone layer by phasing out the production and
consumption of ozone-depleting substances. This agreement is widely considered to 
be one of the most successful international environmental agreements, as it has 
led to a significant reduction in the levels of ozone-depleting 
substances in the atmosphere.

Notable actions of Climate activists:

One notable example is Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who began 
striking from school in August 2018 to protest the lack of action on climate change. Her actions sparked a global movement of youth-led climate strikes, known as Fridays for Future, which has brought attention to the urgent need for action on climate change and has mobilized millions of people around the world.

Greta's speeches and actions have helped to raise awareness of the climate
crisis and have put pressure on governments and businesses to take more
ambitious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts 
of climate change. She has been invited to speak at many international 
forums, including the United Nations Climate Action Summit in 2019, 
where she delivered a powerful speech, where she called out world leaders 
for their lack of action and their empty promises.

This has led into her being the recipient of a lot of awards and honours
like Right Livelihood Award, etc.

Rule of Law and Justice:

Rule of law:
The rule of law refers to a principle of governance in which all persons, including those in government and those in 
the private sector, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, 
and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international 
human rights and standards. It is a concept that is based on the idea 
that everyone should be subject to the same laws and that these laws should be fair, clear, and consistently enforced

Justice:
Justice refers to the fair and impartial treatment of all individuals, 
regardless of their background or circumstances, according to the law. 
It is the principle of fairness and equality that underpins the rule of 
law. Justice can take many forms, including criminal justice, where 
individuals who break the law are held accountable, and social justice, 
where laws and policies aim to ensure that all individuals have equal access
to opportunities and resources.

How are they needed:
Rule of law and justice are both essential for a functioning and
stable society. They provide a framework for protecting the rights
and freedoms of all individuals, and they help to ensure that
everyone is treated fairly and equally under the law.

The 4 questions:

How fair are people you know?
Fairness is a complicated idea that various individuals will interpret 
in different ways. People typically aim to treat others fairly and with 
respect and have a sense of justice and fairness. People are also impacted 
by their own prejudices, ideas, and experiences, which can occasionally 
result in treating others unfairly.

What is unfair?
Unfairness refers to a situation when the outcome is not in proportion 
to the effort, merit or need. Unfairness can manifest in many ways, 
such as discrimination, bias, prejudice, and inequality.

Do people feel they get justice when they reach out to proper channels?
Access to justice and the perception of justice can vary greatly 
depending on a variety of factors, including the individual's 
circumstances, the specific legal system they are engaging with, 
etc. Some people may feel that they have received justice after
reaching out to proper channels, while others may feel that the 
process was unjust or that their concerns were not adequately 
addressed. Sometimes it is the opposite.

Diversity:

Diversity refers to the presence of a variety of differences 
within a group or society, such as differences in race, ethnicity, 
gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, 
religious beliefs, political beliefs, and other characteristics. 
Diversity also includes recognizing and valuing the unique perspectives and 
experiences that individuals bring to the group or society.

The world's Diversity:

.Cultural diversity
.Linguistic diversity
.Ethnic diversity
.Geographic diversity

India's Diversity:

.Cultural diversity
.Linguistic diversity
.Ethnic diversity
.Geographic diversity
.Religious diversity
.Regional diversity
.Economic diversity

International Mindedness:
International mindedness refers to the ability to understand, appreciate, 
and navigate cultural and social differences, as well as being aware of 
one's own cultural biases. It is a mindset that emphasizes the 
interconnectedness of the world and the importance of understanding 
and respecting different perspectives, cultures, and ways of life.

Unity to Diversity:

Constitution:
Constitution can bring people together by providing a framework for governance
and protection of citizens' rights, promoting the rule of law, protecting the
rights of minorities and creating a sense of shared identity.

Cinema:
History has it that Cinema is known to be an important factor to bring people 
together. It can do the following

.Telling stories from diverse perspectives
.Creating a shared cultural experience
.Promoting cultural exchange
.Breaking down language barriers
.Acting as a tool for education

Connection and Application:

I will implement the following In this way:

Geography: 
Learning geography can make a better world by providing a deeper 
understanding of the earth and its inhabitants. It can help 
individuals understand the complex relationships between physical 
and human systems, and how they interact to shape our planet. 
Additionally, understanding geography can help individuals appreciate the 
diversity of cultures and societies around the world, promoting 
tolerance and empathy. Furthermore, geography can also aid in understanding
issues such as climate change, resource management, and sustainable 
development, which are crucial for addressing global challenges.

Civics:
Learning about civics can make me a better person in a lot of ways
like

1)Increased understanding of government and politics
2)Developing critical thinking skills
3)Encouraging civic engagement
4)Promoting social responsibility
5)Promoting informed decision making
6)Builds good citizen

There were 7 units in Civics and Geography where each and every unit 
talked about something essential for me as a person. It all helped me
to grow as a future citizen and be more aware to the current affairs.
I am pretty sure that this knowledge will help me in my life.
